## Uppdate from Jade

Jade has been renamed to Pug. This package will updated your hexo account to use Pug instead of the jade syntax. Pug requires you to change you files from `.jade` to `.pug` for this to work correctly. 

There are also a few minor changes between Jade and Pug 2.0 designed to clean up the code and make it more efficient. You can read about these [here](https://pugjs.org/api/migration-v2.html).
